# PD2 rafineria mod single player

#### This mod fixes a few stupid PD2 balance decisions and makes the single-player gameplay more fun (not balanced).

## Install
Put `data` folder and `default.filter` in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\ProjectD2\` directory. Create shortcut of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\ProjectD2\Diablo II.exe` and start with `-direct -txt -3dfx`.

Loot filter is vanilla friendly. It's for people who don't like to use it but also they don't want to swim in garbage. 

## General changes
- Higher chance of dropping high runes (not very noticeable, but finding a Zod should be slightly less painful)
- All skills can be used in town
- Experience gain is easier after level 90
- Mercenary inventory: 1 ring and 1 amulet
- Charms can be rare
- Sockets are possible in belts, boots, gloves, rings, and amulets
    - Sockets in rings and amulets work like in weapons (e.g., a ruby socket grants fire damage)
- The Countess rune drop chance is slightly increased and can drop up to:
    - **Normal:** Thul (Ral in vanilla)
    - **Nightmare:** Lem (Io in vanilla)
    - **Hell:** Ber (Ist in vanilla)

## Skills
- **Revive**
    - Changed max number of revives. Now it's like in vanilla so max number of revives is the number of Revive skill soft points.
    - Changed HP from [100%] to [200% + (hard point * 20)]
    - Changed duration/level from [10s/level] to [20s/level]
- **Jab**
    - **Fend:** +18% Damage per Level <span style="color:red;">>></span> +20% Damage per Level  
    - **Damage start:** 30% <span style="color:red;">>></span> 50%  
    - **Damage per level:** 20% <span style="color:red;">>></span> 30%  

- **Javelin and Spear Mastery**
    - **Damage start:** 40% <span style="color:red;">>></span> 50%  
    - **Damage per level:** 15% <span style="color:red;">>></span> 20%


## Armor:
- Increased armor rating of elite belts, boots and gloves
- Rebalanced str req of elite belts, boots and gloves
- Increased armor of paladin shields and barb helms
- Increased damage of paladin elite shields
- Decreased str req of several items that had it too high (but increased few that had it too low)
- Increased armor of few items that had it too low (especially elite armors to match missing ETH bug)
